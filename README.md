## Time

- Total time: ~5 hours
- Testing suite needs to be continued to be built out more.

## Lessons Learned

- This lab was difficult, and I need to continue to review the code. Looking at it, I understand how all of the different functionality works, it was just figuring out how to get there that was the hard part. Do code review with David in class was extremely beneficial.
