## Time

- Total time: ~4 hours
- Testing suite needs to be continued to be built out more.

## Lessons Learned

- Much of this lab was already built out with the starter code, and what we did together in class, but I really struggled with missing some time and having to rely more heavily than I would like on the code that we were given. That being said, this experience really helped me to understand what is going on with authentication and middleware. I ran into some big issues with getting my database to work (especially with diff environments, seemed to be having trouble with local memory on test). I had the help of some TAs to figure out what was going on as I kept having errors with my ThunderClient request tests.

- Next lab, I'm going to use this experience to: write MORE comments and use more console logs when things are not behaving as expected. I also need to understand some of the tools we are using a little bit better to troubleshoot (in this instance sqlite and sequelize).
